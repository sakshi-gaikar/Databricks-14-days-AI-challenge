What I explored :<br>
📍 Databricks vs Pandas: Pandas for small data, Databricks for large data 
<br>📍 Databricks vs Hadoop: Hadoop needs more setup, Databricks is easier and faster 
<br>📍 Spark: Processes data by splitting work across multiple systems 
<br>📍 Lakehouse: Data storage and analytics in one place 
<br><br>
What I did hands-on: 
<br>✔️ Created Databricks Community Edition account 
<br>✔️ Explored workspace, compute, and data explorer 
<br>✔️ Created my first notebook 
<br>✔️ Ran basic PySpark commands
