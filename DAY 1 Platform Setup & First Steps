What I explored: 
📍 Databricks vs Pandas: Pandas for small data, Databricks for large data 
📍 Databricks vs Hadoop: Hadoop needs more setup, Databricks is easier and faster 
📍 Spark: Processes data by splitting work across multiple systems 
📍 Lakehouse: Data storage and analytics in one place

What I did hands-on: 
    Created Databricks Community Edition account 
    Explored workspace, compute, and data explorer 
    Created my first notebook 
    Ran basic PySpark commands
